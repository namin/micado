Programmable microfluidics, using multi-layer soft lithography, are lab-on-chip systems that can automate biological computations or experiments by integrating a diverse set of biological sensors and by manipulating fluids at the picoliter scale.

Micado is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool for designing and controlling programmable microfluidics, featuring:
  * standard and customizable design rules
  * automatic routing between control valves and punches
  * automatic generation of control instructions
